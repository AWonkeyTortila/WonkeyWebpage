<h1>Candles</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        No one has loved you as much as I have.
        But no one, my love.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        So much time and memories made together,
        Yet so little time has felt passed by.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        No one has shown you true love.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Nobody has treated you right,
        But I have, my love.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        No one has shown you the whole world.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Nobody has ever held you oh so lovingly,
        But I have, my love.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        When we danced each nigh,
        Nobody has shown you how to enjoy life,
        But I have, my love.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        When we go to the beach at night,
        And make love under the stars,
        No one’s ever loved you so much,
        No one my love.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        And even if you do leave,
        I’ll wait for you, my love.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I’ll treat you like no one ever has
        I will, my love.
    </p>
