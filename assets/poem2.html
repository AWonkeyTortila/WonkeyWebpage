    It's two in the morning and theirs a full moon. There's light rain outside, with the echoes of film noir music and wind. The room is dark, with a light blue tint, from the light of the moon. We're on a bed, cuddled together under a warm navy blue blanket. 
</p>
<p>
    I'm on the left side, and you're on my right side. You're cuddling me, with your right arm on top of my bare chest. I have my right arm around your thin waist. Your hair is long and wet, smelling like roses from the warm shower you took. You're asleep, wearing thin black panties and one of my long sleeve shirts. I'm in a pair of blue shorts, with my chest exposed from not wearing a shirt.
</p>
<p>
    There's a loud boom and the rain starts to get heavier. You start to mumble and turn to look at me. I look at you, and you look at me, and softly say "darling, I'm scared". You get closer to me and cuddle me with both your arms. I turn to look towards you and put my forehead next to yours. You look at me, with your pretty eyes, and we gently kiss.
</p>
<p>
    A little while later, you fall asleep, silently in my arms like a small child. The film noir music starts to echo throughout the night again, and I start to let out tears. I cried and cried, not from sadness, but from pure happiness. The fact that I had someone who loved me with all her heart completed my simple yet painful life.
</p>
<p>
    A little while later, I get up from the soft white matress, and step onto the spruce floor. I walk towards the front door, and see the empty grasslands of rural America and it's night sky, with all of its beautiful stars. A few minutes later, I turn to see you walking up to me in your panties and long sleeve shirt, as you join me with a blanket covering your cold, bare body. You walk next to me, and wrap your blanket around the both of us, than lean on me with your head on my shoulder, pressing your arms and breast against me. We lean together, and watch the night sky together, as we love each other, forever.
