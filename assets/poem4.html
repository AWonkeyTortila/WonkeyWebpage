<div>
    <p>
        To push mountains,
        To make the sun turn into the moon,
        To arouse strippers,
        And to kill another.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        To make a man go mad,
        To make the world go round,
        To summon demons from the ashes??
        To fight wars and battle diseases
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        To have sex even at death.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        To fight disease and the hardest of wars,
        To challenge the gods and their loved ones,
        To make the great oceans rise,
    </p>
</div>

    <p>
        I’ll love you.

<p>Chunk 2</p>
<br>

<div>
    <p>
        I’ll love you
        To arouse strippers,
        To kill another man,
        To fight wars and battle diseases,
        And to travel all seven oceans.

</div>
<div>
    <p>
        To fly across the dark sky,
        To make the moon turn sun,
        To make the great walls fall,
        To end all wars.
    </p>
</div>

<br>
<p>Chunk 4</p>
<br>

<div>
    <p>
        To dance the party of life,

<p>Chunk 5</p>

        To hold your hand and dance the night away,
        To be intimate and make love,
        To grow old and ?
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        To be intimate even after death,
        To be by your side when the world ends,
        To make the night sky erect with fire,
        To watch it all burn, and make a man go mad.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ll love you.
