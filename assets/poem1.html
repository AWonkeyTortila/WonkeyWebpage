<h1>
    The Great Patriotic War Of 1942-1945!
</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        On these horrid nights,
        I march onto deathly battle,
        calm, knowing we'll meet again.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        The dark tundra filled with men,
        who just wanted to return home,
        lay there, never to say their goodbyes.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        My love, to whom I write this letter,
        I know you are sad,
        laying there, next to the empty bedside,
        awaiting my return.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        The dark skies echo of screams,
        with stars dimly twinkling in the dark sky.
        Bullets whistle across the skies,
        as if to greet me.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I'm not saddened nor scared,
        on this deathly night,
        for we'll meet again,
        Whether in this life,
        or in the next.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        On these horrid nights,
        I close my eyes while I fight,
        so I don't relive the horrors that I've done.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        My love,
        I know you miss me,
        awake every night staring at the crib.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I write this letter not to say goodbye,
        for I'll fight until my last breath,
        to repel them from Stalingad,
        and to return home to you, my love.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        On these horrid nights,
        the temperature goes below zero.
        Some die from the cold,
        Others, from the fighting.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Some try to leave,
        But they are shot by their officers.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Time flies by,
        Day by day,
        each feeling like the last. 
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        And so, I am writing this final letter,
        to let you know that you are not alone,
        and that one day I'll come back.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Goodbye.
    </p>
</div>
