    I fly
</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        It’s two AM.
        I’ve packed my bags, and I’m ready to leave.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Mother and father usually argue.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        But mother was worried that day.
        She tried not to cry.
        My father smiled and hugged me for once,
        But he knew it was hopeless.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I was their only son.
        My brother died young,
        And lost my sister in a car accident.
        And soon I’ll join them.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I headed up the road,
        And waited at the bus stop.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        My friends wished me a good trip.
        They told me to write them back,
        And to tell them how New York is.
        But they’ll be disappointed.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        The bus came, and I was all alone.
        I sobbed for a bit,
        And drank a bit of alcohol.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I thought of my loved ones,
        And I heard a voice in my head,
        It tried to stop me.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        But there’s nothing it can do.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I got off the bus, and entered the air port.
        I’ll fly tonight, and fly for one last time.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I waited in the lobby,
        And I sobered up.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        They’ll miss me, I thought,
        It’s not to late to go back.
        But they didn’t try and stop me.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Soon I’ll be in the sky, and amongst the stars.
        Tonight I’ll fly.
        I’ll fly, I’ll fly,
        Tonight I’ll fly.
    </p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <p>
        It’s been so long, that I’ve forgotten your name…
        Hopefully I never forget you, however.
    </p>
