        I don’t believe if there’s a god. I know there’s one. Whether or not it’s a god, goddess, or something, I dunno. I just know there’s someone’s their, and he’s pulling me leg too many times for it to be a coincidence. Perhaps he may want something from me? To tell me something maybe?

        Perhaps I should look deeper into myself to look at what my issues are. Yes, it’ll destroy my existence and perspective of the world to its core, but after death, there is rebirth. And this rebirth, I will become an unrecognizable man.

        It is most likely foolish to think one can change himself so easily. To dare change what is one’s inherent wiring is quite silly actually, like trying to change the will of existence. We are all fake to be honest. We don’t know if the person we are talking to is real or not, for we have no way of seeing the world through their perspective (eyes). For all we know, what we perceive as yellow would be red for example. At best, we could be simply see reality in a different object manner. At worst however, we can never really know if the person or people we talk to in a day to day basis are truly real or not. They could simply be a manifestation of our minds, projected into our subjective reality.

        Perhaps I’m just thinking too deeply about such a basic thing of our lives. But I and perhaps you will never know, since we Weill never be able to 100%, without a single doubt verify this.
